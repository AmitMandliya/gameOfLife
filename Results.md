Conclusions

Threats to validity:
- Our experiment involved speaking with people for 30 minutes each and asking them to find bugs in codes written in languages they have probably never worked in before. We had 3 such codes and realized that it is difficult for the testers to be able to complete debugging the three codes in merely 30 minutes. While some of the testers were able to do it, most were not. Because of this the data collected is insufficient.
- Some of the participants, for the previous homework, had worked on the same code with the same logic in the same language. So they were able to find the syntactical and logical errors a little more easily despite barely knowing the coding language. Had we been working on different games with different logics, they may have taken more time to find the bugs.
- The commit history was public, so that could have been referred to before or during the debugging sessions.
