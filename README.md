# CSC 510 SE HW02
Homework 2 for Fall 2020 CSC510 Software Engineering Group Z22
Due 8/24

### The group members are:
* Amit Mandliya
* Tanvi Pandit
* Krissha Jirawla
* Mukul Vashist
* Himol Shah

# Plan for the code debugging:

1. We will send out the Zoom Link to the participants who signed up for the code-debugging. Two of our team members will watch each person debugging our code and analyze how difficult is it debug the code. Team members will help out in any set up issues or doubts participants might have.
2. Below are the online code compiler urls which already have the buggy version of the code present. Participants can simply click on the url below and make changes to the code. Clicking on "Run" would compile and run the code immediately on the right side console:<br>
Buggy code in Language Julia: https://repl.it/@AmitMandliya1/buggyGameOfLife#main.jl <br>
Buggy code in Language Kotlin: https://repl.it/@himol7/gameOfLife#main.kt <br>
The participants will also have access to our github repository url, in case if they wish to run the code locally.
3. Once, the participant manage to find the bugs and Run the program correctly, one of our team member would inform him and note the time taken.
4. The participant will then proceed to fill up a 5-question form about his debugging experience: https://forms.gle/bU4UvE1Kmfpuojoy7
5. At the end of all the participant's turn, our team will set up a Zoom meeting and identify the best language to code in. The team will also discuss the analysis done during the zoom sessions with the participants.
